# Assignment 1 - Typescript

Welcome to Assignment 1! This is the Typescript setup repository for Assignment 1. You can find the assignment PDF on Canvas.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You hopefully have this already from A0.
If you don't have them installed, you can download them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, install the dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

## Assignment

Currently, this is just starter code with a basic sum function and a test case for it. 

Your task is to implement a REST API for a fitness center, according to the design specifications in the assignment PDF. You are free to use any framework of your choice. We recommend using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as a good starting point.

Once you have created your API, you should also write tests for it in the `test` folder. Your tests should hit all the endpoints in your API and should ensure that they are working correctly. Make sure to test both correct and incorrect API calls.

To test - 
```
npm test
```

To fix linting issues - 
```
npm run fix
```

You can find more helpful commands in the `package.json` file.

## Submission

To submit your assignment, you should take a (FULL) screenshot of all your tests passing and your code passing linting.

You should then upload your screenshot to the assignment submission page on Gradescope.

Good luck and have fun!

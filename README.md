## Assignment 1 - RESTful API
Welcome to Assignment 1! In this assignment, you will be setting up a REST API service from a real life use case. You are free to use Python, Typescript, or Java for this assignment. Read the assignment PDF on Canvas for more details about the implementation required. 

## Background
FitHub Inc. is a burgeoning tech-savvy fitness and wellness center that offers a wide range of classes, personal training sessions, and wellness programs. To optimize and streamline their operations, they're aiming to develop a robust scheduling API.

The proposed API will allow both staff and customers to access, manage, and interact with the center's scheduling system. Users will be able to retrieve information about available classes, trainers, and session timings, and even book or cancel appointments seamlessly.

FitHub Inc. has seen a significant surge in demand for its services, leading to a need for a more efficient way to handle scheduling. The company envisions an API that not only caters to their in-house staff for managing class schedules, trainer availability, and appointment bookings but also offers customers an interface to view and reserve classes, check trainer availability, and receive notifications.

As part of this growth, FitHub Inc. also plans to partner with other fitness centers and wellness facilities. This API will need to accommodate varying requirements, allowing partner centers to integrate their services with FitHubâ€™s scheduling system. For instance, a partner center might want to display FitHub's classes on its website or share trainer availability across both systems.

The assignment will involve designing endpoints, data formats, and error-handling strategies for this scheduling API. It will focus on providing a user-friendly experience for both internal staff and external partners while ensuring the efficiency and extensibility of the system.

## Submission
You are free to use either Python, Typescript, or Java for this assignment. For more information on how to set up your development environment for each language, please refer to the **README.md** files in the respective directories.

Once you have developed and tested the API in your chosen language, do the following to submit:

1. Edit languages.txt and add the language you completed the assignment in. 
`(python/ts/java)`
Make sure to have no trailing spaces or newlines.

2. After completing the assignment by following the instructions in the README.md files, take a (FULL) screenshot of all your tests passing.

3. You should then upload a document with your chosen language, a link to your repository, and your screenshot; to the assignment submission page on Gradescope.

4. Committing and pushing your code to github would automatically trigger the autograder for your test cases. You can check the status of your submission on the Github actions tab.
